FIFA 18 Ratings

The FiFa 18 rating dataset contains information about all the players present in the game. It gives us different player information like Nationality, age, Club and most important of all the player ratings at different positions.

The formation dataset is a custom dataset created by me using Tableau drawing tools and extracting the co-ordinates at each position.
The dashboard filters players according to Country and wage. This has been made possible by using a lot of parameters, calculated fields and LOD expressions.
